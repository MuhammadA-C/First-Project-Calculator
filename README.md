# First-Project-Calculator
First Programming Project- Calculator (Console App) - Language: C#

Purpose of this project- I wanted to start practicing more my programming skills, and programming in C#. 

Overview: This is an extremely simple calculator that's in the console,
and that only performs 4 functions (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division).

Drawbacks of this calculator:
1. It only performs 4 functions- (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division).
2. It's in the console and has no GUI. 
3. It doesn't allow users to backtrack from the previous step to do things such as change the value they inputted/no clear option.
4. There's no way to handle wrong values that users may input.
5. There's no way to exit out of the app.

These drawbacks from version 1 of the Calculator can be addressed in future versions.
